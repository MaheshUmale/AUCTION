This file summarizes the work I've completed, the issues I'm facing, and the next steps to resolve them.

**Work Completed**

*   **Implemented a `ThreadPoolExecutor`:** I've added a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to the `LiveMarketRouter` to handle database writes asynchronously.
*   **Refactored the `on_message` method:** The `on_message` method now submits the `_save_feed_data` function to the thread pool, preventing the main thread from being blocked by database writes.
*   **Added a graceful shutdown mechanism:** I've implemented a `shutdown()` method in `LiveMarketRouter` and called it from `main_live.py` and `backtester.py` to ensure all pending database writes are completed before the application exits.

**Issues**

*   **Failing test:** The new test, `tests/test_throughput.py`, is failing. The `test_throughput_without_threading` test is not correctly unpacking the values returned by the `_save_feed_data` method.

**Next Steps**

*   **Debug the test:** The `test_throughput_without_threading` test needs to be fixed to correctly unpack the values returned by the `_save_feed_data` method.
*   **Remove the test:** If the test cannot be fixed, it should be removed before merging the code.
